        <p>

      <h3>Petrol Station Digitization Project</h3>
        <p>
          Ali's Oil currently keeps only paper records. While this method has been sufficient until now, further growth requires a more scalable
          method of recordkeeping. They hope to achieve this using a digital solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          FFDS has been chosen to specify requirements for the petrol station digitization project. The final product should be able to track
          transactions at the station, manage employee data and track customer debts. Completion of the requirements stage of this project is 
          estimated for April 2019.
