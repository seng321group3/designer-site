      <h3>Faculty of Education's Request</h3>
        <p class="foe-body">
          The Faculty of Education has requested the help of QED Technologies to assist in better optimizing their academic advising system. 
          The current system implemented by the Faculty of Education is comprised of physical printed records and handwritten notes containing 
          important information for each student. For academic advisors to access specific information on a student they must physically retrieve the 
          students respective folder from a filing cabinet. This may require the advisor to sift through the folders containing large amounts 
          of information not relevant to what the advisor is trying to find. It is required under the current system that these documents 
          are updated by hand, which can lead to unclear or difficult to read annotations. Additonally, the current system has no method to view 
          student or cohort performance in a graphical representation. Therefore, the Faculty of Education requests a proposed solution in better 
          optimizing their academic advising system to provide a more efficient, reliable, and effective service for academic advisors and students.
